To Learn:
The basic way to erform a basic reset using universal selector;
How to set roject-wide font definations;
How to clip parts of elements using clip-path




1. Universal Selector: when we want to apply some styles to all the elements in our page
write something like 
* {
    //Css code
}

2. By Default, any browser will add some padding to our website, to avoid that, initally add padding to zero.
 
3.     box-sizing: border-box;    - which means borders and padding are no longer added to the total width and height we specify for the box

4. We can add fonts in the header of html itself and directly link itself <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lato:100,300,400,700,900" rel="stylesheet">


* vh stands for viewport height and vw is for viewport width. Hence, setting an element to a width value of 50vw means that the element will have a width that's 50% of the viewport size, and this stays true when the viewport is resized.
 height: 95vh; which means 95 percent of the available height

* background-size: cover; it will cover the viewport height or width which is opened

* background-position: top|center|bottom   - this will make sure that the image will stick at that position when the size of the window is being resized manually or automatically

5. linear-gradient: This is the concept to give a light color on our bacground image or just our bacground, we can increase or decrease the opacity and boom, the nice flaovour on your website is on.
    background-image:linear-gradient(to right bottom,#7ed56f42,#28b4853f) , url('../img/hero.jpeg');
    We can specify prior to the url of the image from bacground-image attribute
    background-image:linear-gradient(to right bottom,hsla(111, 55%, 64%, 0.801),hsla(160, 64%, 43%, 0.801)) , url('../img/hero.jpeg');

6. Concept called clip-path, which will clip our division
 - to make a triangle, hexacon anything, just visit this website

7. Absolute positining should always have parent relative so that it will take parents as a container reference and be Absolute.
  text-transform: uppercase; will change the lowercase to upper case

8. display: block ;  // block elements create line breaks before and after... Block occupies 100% of the width, suppose if we want an element to be the king in that width, then use display block



9. How to add the text in the center as the heading, first make sure that the parent body is relative with bla bla view port.
    - Add a division tag and give a class name, and in the css, make sure the position is Absolute, top 50% and left 50%, which will be exactly the center, but the problem is that it will start at center but it looks like it's a right padded component, so to overcome that, write a transform method where we transform the text 50% to the left and top. By doing this the element will be exactly center.
    - transform: translate(-50%,-50%);

10 Animations:
    Like mentioned, there are two types of animation, write transform or do onHover.

11. Write about transition and how we assign it

12. pseudo classes are the concept which are attached to action items like button or anchor tag. It is used to perform specific action
        .btn:link{

        }
        .btn:visited{

        }
    keyframes :
    it is the concept where we specify the transition properties.



Three pillers:
1. Responsive design - one website with all device screen size
2. Maintainable and scalable code.
3. Web performance


Load the html, parse the html, load the css, resolve all the conflicts, document object model, css object model, render tree, website rendering : the visual formatting model, final rendered website
