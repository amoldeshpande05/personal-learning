Heap is a complete binary tree, where every node will have 2 children except the last child.

- There are two heaps, max heap where node will have larger value from its children, and vice versa for min heap
- complete binary tree will have length of log(n)

Denote a tree to an array,

to get any parent of a node then

parent(i) = |i/2|
leftchild(i)=2*i
right child= 2*i+1
