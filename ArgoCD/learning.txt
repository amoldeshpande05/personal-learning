Initially we used to deploy with jenkins
Problem:
1. Install and setup tools like kubectl,docker,ibmcloud ... etc
2. Configure access to k8, ibmcloud etc
3. configure access to ibmcloud
4. Security challenge, as the credentials might be compromised
5. No visiblity of deployment status


ARGOCD was built to deploy to kubernetes

Instead of present in the separate server, the ARGOCD is part of k8s cluster.
ArgoCD agent pulls k8s manifest changes and applies them
