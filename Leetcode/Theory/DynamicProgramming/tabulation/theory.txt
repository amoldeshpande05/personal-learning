Tabulation
It's about building the table
Instead of recurssion, we use iteration




1) Visualize as a table, size is based on the inputs
2) Initialse value within the table, it is based on the output you want, wheater its numbers, boolean or string
3) Seed the trivial answer into the table
4) Iterate through the table
5) fill further positions based on the current positions
